# Overview
This page documents my experiences with creating my Shopping Store full stack project. I embed a video demo that shows the frontend at work, and the statuses of the database in after different CRUD updates.

# Discussion
I wanted to create a non-trivial full stack project that incorporated real-time CRUD updates to a relational database, and a React frontend with somewhat complex component state managment (not so complex to require something like Redux). Although creating the database models and backend was relatively straightforward, the frontend was easily the most complex part of this project.

In terms of implementing this project, I started with setting up the database models, then store backend, then finally the frontend.
